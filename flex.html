                    A while ago I created this bot that <a href="https://vasilis.nl/nerd/the-daily-dwagd-an-inspiration-bot/">fetches a work from the Drawings, Prints and Graphic Design Department</a> of the <a href="https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/">Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum</a> and <a href="https://vasilis.nl/daily-dwagd/">posts it to a website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyDwagd">to twitter, three times a day.</a> I like this pace. It’s not an overload. But sometimes it’s not enough. What if I want a new image <em>right</em> now. The easy option would be to surf to the <a href="https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/">Cooper Hewitt site</a> and add a query into the search field. The not so easy option would be to create a twitter bot that posts an image of a thing if you ask it to. Politely.

                    So imagine that you’re bored and you want to see an image of a shark. Now you can ask <a href="https://twitter.com/onethingplease">@onethingplease</a> to send you<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@onethingplease+a+shark,+please"> a shark, please.</a> Be sure to include the word ‘please’. It’s a sensitive bot that will not answer you without it. And right so. The internet can use some manners. But if you do ask it politely it will do its best to find an image of a shark — or whatever you ask it — in the Cooper Hewitt collection. And after a few minutes of searching it will <b>probably</b> send it to you. Or well. Probably not. It is not that accurate. But the results are definitely more surprising than all those fancy “intelligent” image search algorithms we’re used to.
                    
                    A few of you will try it out. And ask it to send you an image of beer. Or wine. Or a book. Or a computer. Or a lion. Or an alien. But most of the time this bot will be idling. In order to prevent it from getting too bored I gave it the power to update its profile pictures if nobody has asked it anything in the last 30 minutes. This means it will probably do this at least 40 times a day. And nobody will notice. Which makes you wonder. If a bot updated its profile pictures and no human saw it, did it actually happen?

                            Last week I was working on a course with a colleague of mine. After a while he told me to take a break. He suggested me to play a game called Pause on my phone. I told him that instead of playing games during my break, I usually take a look at the ceiling. And when I looked up I realised that most ceilings in offices are rather dull. So I created the Ceiling Bot.

                            If you let it, that site will notify you every two hours that it is time to take a look at the ceiling. If you click on the notification you’ll see a new ceiling. Most of these ceilings are probably much more interesting that the one you see when you look up right now. Like this incredible glass dome. Or this chandelier. 10 minutes is probably not enough to see all the details in this ceiling of a mosque. Or this ceiling in a bar. It looks like in the past ceilings were much more important than they are today. Looks like we’re not very interested in looking up anymore.
                            
                            If you like, you can follow the ceiling bot on Twitter as well.
                            
                            One day I might create a back-to-work-bot that shows you a computer screen after the ten minute break is over.
